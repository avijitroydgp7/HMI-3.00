# File Saving Issue Fix

## Problem
Files appear to save (UI updates) but are not actually written to disk due to placeholder implementations.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Implement Real File I/O in ProjectService
- [x] Add JSON import for data serialization
- [x] Implement actual `save_project()` method with file writing
- [x] Implement actual `load_project()` method with file reading
- [x] Add proper error handling for file operations

### Phase 2: Update MainWindow Save Methods
- [x] Modify `save_project()` to handle real file I/O
- [x] Modify `save_project_as()` to handle real file I/O
- [x] Add user feedback for save operations
- [x] Handle file path validation

### Phase 3: Data Serialization
- [x] Serialize central widget content (QTextEdit data)
- [x] Handle project metadata (file path, save state)
- [x] Add support for future dock widget states

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test basic save/load functionality
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify files appear in correct locations
- [ ] Test with different file paths and permissions

## Current Status
- [x] Issue identified and analyzed
- [x] Implementation completed - Ready for testing
